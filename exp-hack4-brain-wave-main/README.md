# EXP-hack4-brain-wave



## Getting started

รวม code ที่บ้าน EXP ใช้ใน hackathon : brain wave 4

### Preprocessing
(hack4_visualize-2.ipynb) for contributing preprocess dataset 

(signal_prepv2.ipynb) for testing and also creating preprocess function

(hack4_preprocess.ipynb) for everyone who want to modify all preprocess function and initiate their own dataset


### Feature Extraction 
(feature_extraction_1.ipynb) for doing feature Extraction

### Model
(EEGConformer.ipynb)

(EEGITNet.ipynb)

(GCN_clean_code.ipynb)

(eeg_defomer.ipynb)

(hack4_visualize-2.ipynb) 

There are a lot of models we have tried. Some of them are Image models. EEGNet is the state of the art model we used.
